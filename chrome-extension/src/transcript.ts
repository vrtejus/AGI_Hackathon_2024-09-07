So corporate events they I think I saw a little I put this in Slack, and I saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good. You know that the nutshell here is, as we've kind of restructured and try different things, the event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be. So the current tactic that we're going with is go to market team signs up and kind of sponsors that event. So you support as a PMM, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A I don't see anyone in the maybe their comments in the issue.

Candidly, this is always a little bit tough. And I'm and I'm, I am not totally sure of all of the kind of the interplay here, but I think, I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment is, okay, we have commit coming up, we have some amount of like, we have a stage, you know, a metaphorical stage, to say something to the world, and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make do? Um at GitLab, it's really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire roadmap is completely public, yada yada yada. So the thought here is to but also because our entire roadmap is completely public, and because we ship these tiny little MVCs, and a new feature will come out, but it'll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say, okay, like what started in the last year, but now is really like a full fledged feature, what would, what would be coming out of beta, right? Like, if we were any other company and we started a beta program in this last year, what would we be announcing as GA at commit. That's kind of, that's kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of head nods. What do you think? Sydney,"

But if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this. It makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual little thing. And then the other point was, we just had 14 Dotto Can we just, can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here?"

So I think, yeah, this is like, let's take the stuff from 14 Dotto and then maybe add a few more, so that we can hit kind of different areas of press. Or give, give our PR team. This is kind of like input into our PR team to give them fodder to go out with.  Unknown Speaker  6:42 And are we trying to hit three per stage?"

And if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick I was going Cindy's direction here, which was thinking, you know, a lot of and then I call them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things, like three or four per each as key iterations. But I called them something overall. So we would have, like one thing to call them. There's several key iterations aligned with giddeley cluster, several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket, except that actually, that's that's super typical, right? Like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things, and then they mention a longer list of stuff that aligns to that. So I, you know, forgave myself for doing something at first, I was kind of, like, shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there. But actually, when I looked around. That's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level, that also, like, I went in thinking this is just a two, I guess part of it is like, I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken, and that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about. But actually some of that stuff's really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasn't sure exactly where to place things, but I figured I wouldn't like the Cindy's comment. Have something that's a one here anyway, but I the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to bucket them as something. And so that's kind of how I came down on it. Everyone thinks about that. I  Unknown Speaker  9:05 about that."

And I was looking through features, and, you know, actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but it's not very exciting, but we can bundle that with some other things. Things and up level it. So that would be helpful there.

Wherever we have it is, it's probably something we can, we can use, yeah, but we, of course, we need a benchmark level of what Mau we want to call one, two or three."

Now, depending on how it's asked for, maybe that means it's exciting or it's not right, but usually when something gets a lot of upvotes, or when there's a lot of demand for it, then I would, I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly, if something shifted, a lot of people are using it the Mau, that's a, that's another good measure. I don't know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think it's a bit of a, it's a bit of an individual judgment call. And just like, What is, what is your feeling based on, you know, could be anecdotal, like you talk to customers and they're, like, really hyper excited about this."

Alternatively, if there are double digit entries, then we can stack rank. So that's that's kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these that, I mean, it looks like we're going to get there, and that's going to be quite a lot of features. So I might constrain it like this. Maybe you can only give out 112, or three and treat it as a stack rank, rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't necessarily"

And, yeah, maybe it's some things that have been around for a while, but like now they're at a level of maturity now, you know, there's, there's reason to be excited about this.

My guess was, or my understanding was, that we wouldn't have the same set of competitors that we're going to compare to, but the right competitors for that particular stage, right? So for example, for for monitor we may not have, like a GitHub or something like that, we would have monitor based competitors. Or was that the understanding, because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage. I thought we were going to be using those competitors to compare against. So I just wanted your your input on what because I saw some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there, they may not be relevant. For example, cloud beats may not be relevant for monitor stage at all. So that's what I wanted to check"
